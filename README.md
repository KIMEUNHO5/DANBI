# 💧 DANBI

DANBI, a service that helps to manage my family water intake.


## Abstract

Now that humans, pets, and plants all live in a family, there are many things to care about and it is becoming difficult to manage them at once. We developed 'DANBI' that intuitively manages water intake information of all members of our family at once focusing on water, which is the basis of all life. DANBI is our water secretary which informs us when necessary with convenience through technical linkage with LG PuriCare water purifiers and NUGU speakers.


## Introduction

DANBI is a service designed for family members who need water intake information.

Moisture is the most basic necessary factor for human to maintain life. Drinking less water increases the risk of exposure to various diseases. Nevertheless, the percentage of 'sufficient water intake' decreases every year, and 6 out of 10 people are reported not drinking enough water. Therefore, we planned this service using applications and NUGU AI speakers.

This service is not just for humans, but also allows to manage the supply of pets and plants together. 

In modern society, the form of family composition is changing. More and more people have pets and plants, and unlike before, they have begun to regard them as family members. As a result, people became more interested in their health care as family members.

The water intake of pets and plants is also directly related to their life support. In the case of pets, diseases can occur if water intake is not performed properly. In addition, in the case of plants, if the cells do not have enough water, they become malnourished and cannot support their weight. Therefore, we have developed a DANBI that helps manage moisture in humans, pets, and plants, that is, all of our families.

Like welcome rain that falls on dry land, our DANBI will provide essential water intake information for humans, pets, and plants in our busy modern society.


## Main Function

***# COMBINE***  
**Managing human, pets and plants, everyone in our family's drink water at once at DANBI**  
There is no longer a need to dirty your cell phone wallpaper with numerous apps. All members of our family can manage their water intake at once in **DANBI**.

***# AUTOMATE***  
**Automatic water discharge and automatic water intake register**  
**DANBI** automatically calculates the recommended amount of water intake and the interval between water intake based on each individual's physiological information. Notifications are provided when the set water intake time is reached. The user selects one of '물받기', '마시기', and '미루기'. It automatically updates water intake information according to the user's reaction. If the user selects '물받기' in response to the notification, the LG PuriCare water purifier automatically releases water according to the amount and temperature set by the user.

***# VISUALIZE***  
**Check the water intake record visually**  
**DANBI** provides visual data on the member's water intake status. In addition, when achieving the daily target amount, the calendar is stamped to encourage users to consume steady water.

***# COMMUNICATE***  
**Ask NUGU speaker about water intake**  
When the user asks about the water intake information, the NUGU speaker, along with the nickname, guides the current water intake, the last water intake time, and the next water intake date and time.
